## Gameplay

Your goal is to extend your track as long as possible without crashing.

Crashes can be caused by three things:

- Driving off the grass
- Driving into your own track
- Driging into a powered rail at an incorrect angle

> You can't turn directly off a powered rail

## Controls

- Arrow keys control movement direction
